###  An Efficient Updation Approach for Enumerating Maximal (∆, γ)-Cliques of a Temporal Network

A (∆, γ)-clique is defined as tuple of vertex set and time interval pair, where all the vertices are connected at least γ times in each ∆ duration of the time interval.  We study the maximal (∆, γ)-clique enumeration problem in online setting; i.e.; the entire link set of the network is not known in advance, and the links are coming as a batch in an iterative manner.
